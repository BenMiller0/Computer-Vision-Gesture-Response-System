# Computer Vision Attraction

## 🌌 Overview
Welcome, Padawan!
This project harnesses the power of computer vision and real-world sensing to interact with the environment, like using the Force. Leveraging PyTorch, an Raspberry Pi 5 (RPI 5), an RPI AI Camera, and ultrasonic sensors with Arduino, this setup detects objects, measures distance, and reacts in real time.

This project is being developed by the Themed Entertianment Assosiation at UC San Diego. This repo is contians our entire code base!
